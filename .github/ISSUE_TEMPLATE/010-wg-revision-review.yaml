        Thank you for sending us your specification for review.

        * Use links to content rather than pasting text into this issue. Issues are ephemeral and most of the material we are asking for has long term value.
        * Please preview the issue and check that the links work before submitting.
        * Please make sure anyone with the link can access the document, especially if you've used Google Docs. We may refuse to review anything that is not public.

      label: Explainer
      description: |
        An explainer must describe the problem that your proposed feature aims to solve **from an end-user's perspective**. It must also show example pieces of code that use the proposed solution to solve the user-facing problems. See our [explanation of how to write a good explainer](https://w3ctag.github.io/explainer-explainer/#introduction).

        If all of this information is contained in your specification or other documents and will be readable by people who aren't fluent in your domain, you don't need a separate explainer.

      description: |
        For your own organization, you can simply state the organization's position instead of linking to it.  This includes items on [Mozilla standards-positions](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions), and [WebKit standards-positions](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions).  Chromium doesn't have a standards-positions repository and [prefers](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:docs/standards/positions/GoogleChrome/README.md) to use comments from the teams that maintain the relevant area of their codebase.

        - Active horizontal reviews: https:// <!-- Link to an issue like https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/239, https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/1804, or https://github.com/w3c/did/issues/885, which itself links to the other horizontal reviews. If you haven't started the rest of the wide reviews, please consider doing so. -->
        - Multi-stakeholder feedback:
          - Chromium comments:
          - Mozilla comments: https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/NNN <!-- And/or other places they've given feedback -->
