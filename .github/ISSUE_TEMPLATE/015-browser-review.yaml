        Thank you for sending us your specification review. If a Working Group generally agrees about this feature, we prefer to have them take it through wide review. If they're willing to do that, please [switch to the WG new specification review template](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/new?template=005-wg-new-spec-review.yaml). Otherwise, if you're planning to ship the feature anyway, please continue to file the review with this form.

        Use links to content rather than pasting text into this issue. Issues are ephemeral and most of the material we are asking for has long term value.

        Please preview the issue and check that the links work before submitting. Please make sure anyone with the link can access the document. We may refuse to review anything that is not public.

This includes items on [Mozilla standards-positions](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions), and [WebKit standards-positions](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions).  Chromium doesn't have a standards-positions repository and [prefers](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:docs/standards/positions/GoogleChrome/README.md) to use comments from the teams that maintain the relevant area of their codebase.
