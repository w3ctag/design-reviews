CAREFULLY READ AND DELETE CONTENT BELOW THIS LINE BEFORE SUBMITTING

Use links to content rather than pasting text into this issue. Issues are ephemeral and most of the material we are asking for has long term value.

Please preview the issue and check that the links work before submitting. Please make sure anyone with the link can access the document. We may refuse to review anything that is not public.

¹ We require an explainer to give the relevant context for the spec review, even if the spec has some background information. An explainer must address user needs and contain examples of use.  For more information, see our [explanation of how to write a good explainer](https://tag.w3.org/explainers/).

² A Security and Privacy questionnaire helps us understand potential security and privacy issues and mitigations for your design, and can save us asking redundant questions. See https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/.

³ For your own organization, you can simply state the organization's position instead of linking to it.  This includes items on [Mozilla standards-positions](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions), and [WebKit standards-positions](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions).  Chromium doesn't have a standards-positions repository and [prefers](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:docs/standards/positions/GoogleChrome/README.md) to use comments from the teams that maintain the relevant area of their codebase.

⁴ Include links to [Chrome Status](https://chromestatus.com/), [Mozilla's](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/), [WebKit's Bugzilla](https://bugs.webkit.org/), and trackers for other implementations if those are known to you.
