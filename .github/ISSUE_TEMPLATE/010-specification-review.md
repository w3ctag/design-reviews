Further details:

  - Relevant time constraints or deadlines: [please provide]
  - [ ] I have read and filled out the [Self-Review Questionnare on Security and Privacy](https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/). The [assessment is here](url).
  - [ ] I have reviewed the TAG's [API Design Principles](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/)

We recommend the explainer to be in [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). On top of the [usual information expected in the explainer](https://w3ctag.github.io/explainers), it is strongly recommended to add:

You should also know that...

[please tell us anything you think is relevant to this review]

We'd prefer the TAG provide feedback as (please select one):

  - [ ] open issues in our GitHub repo for each point of feedback
  - [ ] open a single issue in our GitHub repo for the entire review
  - [ ] leave review feedback as a comment in this issue and @-notify [github usernames]

_Please preview the issue and check that the links work before submitting._ In particular, if anything links to a URL which requires authentication (e.g. Google document), please make sure anyone with the link can access the document.
