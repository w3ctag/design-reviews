Saluton TAG!

  - Tests: [wpt folder(s), if available]
  - Security and Privacy self-review²: [url]
  - GitHub repo (if you prefer feedback filed there): [url]
  - Primary contacts (and their relationship to the specification):
      - [name] ([github username]), [organization/s] (repeat as necessary, we recommend including group chairs and editors in this list)
  - Organization(s)/project(s) driving the specification: [organization and/or project name] 
  - Key pieces of existing multi-stakeholder review or discussion of this specification: 
  - External status/issue trackers for this specification (publicly visible, e.g. Chrome Status):

You should also know that...

[please tell us anything you think is relevant to this review]

We'd prefer the TAG provide feedback as (please delete all but the desired option):

  🐛 open issues in our GitHub repo for **each point of feedback**

  ☂️ open a single issue in our GitHub repo **for the entire review**

  💬 leave review feedback as a **comment in this issue** and @-notify [github usernames]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAREFULLY READ AND DELETE CONTENT BELOW THIS LINE BEFORE SUBMITTING

Please preview the issue and check that the links work before submitting.

In particular, if anything links to a URL which requires authentication (e.g. Google document), please make sure anyone with the link can access the document. We would prefer fully public documents though, since we work in the open.

¹ We require an explainer to give the relevant context for the spec review, even if the spec has some background information. For background, see our [explanation of how to write a good explainer](https://w3ctag.github.io/explainers). We recommend the explainer to be in [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

² A Security and Privacy questionnaire helps us understand potential security and privacy issues and mitigations for your design, and can save us asking redundant questions. See https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/.
