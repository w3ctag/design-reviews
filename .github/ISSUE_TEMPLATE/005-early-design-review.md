こんにちは TAG-さん!

I'm requesting an early TAG design review of {{feature}}.

{{One paragraph summary of idea, ideally copy-pasted from your Explainer.}}

  - Explainer¹:
  - User research:
  - Security and Privacy self-review²:
  - GitHub repo:
  - Primary contacts:
      - $name (@-mention), $organization/s, $role in developing specification
      - {{repeat as necessary, we recommend including group chairs and editors in this list}}
  - Organization/project driving the design:
  - This work is being funded by:
  - Incubation and standards groups that have discussed the design:
    - {{ABC CG}} <!-- Include a link to minutes or issues in this group if possible. -->
    - {{DEF WG}}
  - Standards group(s) that you expect to discuss and/or adopt this work when it's
    ready: <!-- "unknown" if not known -->
  - Multi-stakeholder feedback³:
    - Chromium comments:
    - Mozilla comments: https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/NNN <!-- And/or other places they've given feedback -->
    - WebKit comments: https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/NNN <!-- And/or other places they've given feedback -->
    - {{...include feedback/review from developers, implementers, civil society, and others}}
  - Major unresolved issues with or opposition to this design:

  - [ ] I have reviewed the TAG's [Web Platform Design Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/)

You should also know that...

{{Please tell us anything else you think is relevant to this review.}}

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAREFULLY READ AND DELETE CONTENT BELOW THIS LINE BEFORE SUBMITTING

Use links to content rather than pasting text into this issue. Issues are ephemeral and most of the material we are asking for has long term value.

Please preview the issue and check that the links work before submitting. Please make sure anyone with the link can access the document. We may refuse to review anything that is not public.

¹ An explainer must address user needs and contain examples of use. See our [explanation of how to write a good explainer](https://tag.w3.org/explainers/).

² Even for early-stage ideas, a Security and Privacy questionnaire helps us understand potential security and privacy issues and mitigations for your design, and can save us asking redundant questions. See https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/.

³ For your own organization, you can simply state the organization's position instead of linking to it.  This includes items on [Mozilla standards-positions](https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions), and [WebKit standards-positions](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions).  Chromium doesn't have a standards-positions repository and [prefers](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:docs/standards/positions/GoogleChrome/README.md) to use comments from the teams that maintain the relevant area of their codebase.
