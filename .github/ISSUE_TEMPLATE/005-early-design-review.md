  - User research: [url to public summary/results of research]
  - Security and Privacy self-review²: [url]
  - GitHub repo (if you prefer feedback filed there): [url]
  - Primary contacts (and their relationship to the specification):
      - [name] ([github username]), [organization/s] (repeat as necessary, we recommend including group chairs and editors in this list)
  - Organization/project driving the design: [organization and/or project name]
  - External status/issue trackers for this feature (publicly visible, e.g. Chrome Status):

Further details:

You should also know that...

[please tell us anything you think is relevant to this review]

We'd prefer the TAG provide feedback as (please delete all but the desired option):

  🐛 open issues in our GitHub repo for **each point of feedback**

  ☂️ open a single issue in our GitHub repo **for the entire review**

  💬 leave review feedback as a **comment in this issue** and @-notify [github usernames]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAREFULLY READ AND DELETE CONTENT BELOW THIS LINE BEFORE SUBMITTING

Please preview the issue and check that the links work before submitting.

In particular:
* if anything links to a URL which requires authentication (e.g. Google document), please make sure anyone with the link can access the document. We would prefer public documents though, since we work in the open.

¹ For background, see our [explanation of how to write a good explainer](https://tag.w3.org/explainers/). We recommend the explainer to be in [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

² Even for early-stage ideas, a Security and Privacy questionnaire helps us understand potential security and privacy issues and mitigations for your design, and can save us asking redundant questions. See https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/.
