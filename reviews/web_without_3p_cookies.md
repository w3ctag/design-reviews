# Improving the web platform without third party cookies

The TAG has received an increasing number of review requests for new technologies that enhance or explicitly point out their implications for privacy on the web. This is a positive development for the web as more people involved in its development consider the important role privacy should play in the future of the web platform. We consider privacy a core design principle, and differentiator for the web platform [[unsanctioned tracking](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/unsanctioned-tracking/), [private browsing](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/private-browsing-modes/)].

[Third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie) are a key technology supporting tracking networks, which have been identified as a major threat to privacy [CITATION NEEDED].

Cookies were originally designed for recognising repeat visitors to a website [[RFC2109](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2109.html)].
They have since been repurposed for third parties (someone other than the website being used), for use cases like login and single sign-on, tracking state like putting shopping choices into a cart, tracking to better target advertising, detecting fraud for forms/transactions/ad performance, measurement and attribution of ad clicks, [TODO: other use cases?]. Simply put, this increase in data collection and sharing about people using the web - often in a way that is opaque or incomprehensible to a web user - results in decreased individual and collective privacy. In the Ethical Web Principles, we assert that [security and privacy are essential](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#privacy); a reduction in privacy also has implications for [freedom of expression](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#expression), [supporting healthy communities](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#community) and the [enhancement of individual control and power](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#control). 

In this context, many browsers are restricting or completely deprecating the use of of third-party cookies [[webkit](https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/)]. **The TAG supports efforts to deprecate third-party cookies. In addition, we see this as an opportunity to further improve the privacy preserving features of the web platform.**

We are strongly in favour of innovations in alternative ways to to build sustainable business models on the web platform, which may include forms of advertising that do not track or collect data about people, or other models entirely. [TODO: find some links]

We aspire for the web to have a [net positive social benefit](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/), however targeted advertising, as currently deployed on the web, has been shown to have negative social impacts [CITATION]. In light of this, for any technologies put forward to enable targeted advertising in the absence of third-party cookies to claim that they can do so while preserving privacy, the proposers need to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that really is the case. Similarly, these technologies also must not consolidate power in the hands of large organizations.

Some features of the web that people have come to expect, and which greatly improve user experience, currently depend on third-party cookies. Continuing to support these use cases is important in the absence of third-party cookies. We are supportive of approaches that are designed-for-purpose and built to respect user privacy, in favour of more general replacements for third-party cookies which are at risk of recreating the same issues caused by third-party cookies.

Some recent good examples of this approach include:

* [FedCM](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/718). Third-party cookies are used to support single sign-on. FedCM is a set of technologies built to support single sign-on and identity federation, without replicating all functionality of third-party cookies.
* [CHIPS](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/654). The goal of CHIPS is to avoid a drawback of third party cookies - tracking across web sites that don't know they are collaborating with each other. CHIPS allows state without supporting correlation between web sites, for example, for embedding third-party services like customer service webchat.
* [Fenced Frames](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/735). This provides a new top-level browsing contenxt which enables content from multiple parties to be embedded on a page, without the embedding site being able to communicate with the embedded site. The [TAG review](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/735#issuecomment-1226822420) carries the caveat that it will be important to review how fenced frames might interact with other emerging or proposed APIs.

The TAG's approach is to consider each new technology proposal *both* individually, *and* as they fit together with the web platform as a whole. The web must be cross-platform, so multi-stakeholder support for privacy-related specifications is essential if they are going to achieve the goal of increasing privacy on the web.

We should avoid introducing new technologies that, when deployed in combination, effectively preserve the status quo of harmful tracking. This was a concern the [TAG already expressed](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/blob/main/reviews/first_party_sets_feedback.md) when reviewing the [First Party Sets proposal](https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets).

Some of these new technologies have been presented in the context of umbrella initiatives such as [Privacy Sandbox](https://www.privacysandbox.com/). We advocate for experimenting and innovating around new approaches, but note that not all initiatives worked on have a certain path towards standardisation or implementation. We are also wary of new approaches being introduced while third-party cookies are still available to authors, as this comes with a risk that more, parallel channels for privacy invasion become possible, rather than fewer. Further, the replacement technologies must be not add excessive complexity to the web platform, and should be accessible to smaller development teams and individual developers [[Prefer Simple Solutions](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#simplicity)]. Specification authors are encouraged to keep this in mind when considering the risks and trade-offs of emerging technologies.

In conclusion, when accommodating changes caused by the deprecation of third-party cookies we should not replicate the same privacy issues that caused third-party cookies to be harmful in the first place. Aligned with the goal of [leaving the web better than we found it](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#leave-the-web-better), we should instead be improving the situation for user privacy across the web platform. We should be aiming for signifigantly better privacy rather than slightly better privacy.
